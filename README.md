# Warnercloud.net

This repository holds my personal website. I built it using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) with the [congo theme](https://github.com/jpanther/congo).

This site will hold a blog and a directory of finished and planned projects.

You can find the site live at [warnercloud.net](https://warnercloud.net).
