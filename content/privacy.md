## Data Collection

This site uses [GoatCounter](https://www.goatcounter.com/) for analytics. No personally identifiable data is collected, and I use a self hosted instance, so only I have access to the data it collects. See [their privacy policy](https://www.goatcounter.com/help/privacy) for more detialed information. Additionally, since no personal data is collected, this site probably does not require a GDPR consent notice as documented in [GoatCounter's documentation](https://www.goatcounter.com/help/gdpr)
