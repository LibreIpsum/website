I want to make a fan film/series set during order 66. The following posts will document my progress.

The working title for the project is *The Escape: A Star Wars Story*

## Current Status as of Late 2025

Currently, this project is in the very early preproduction stage. I have not even started on a script. I'm fleshing out the details of the story and working on some test shots. Once I decide on a funding scheme, I can find actors and write a screenplay and storyboard.
