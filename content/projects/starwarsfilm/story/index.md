The story is set in 19 BBY, during the same timeframe as *Revenge of the Sith.* It follows a Jedi who has been sent to Tattooine with the mission to secure Hutt shipping routes for Republic use. Before he reaches Jabba's pallace, the Jedi is ambushed by his clone troopers, forcing him to run.

A previous incedent, revealed through a flashback gave the jedi enough distrust for the clones to be prepared for their attack. He flees to Mos Eisley, where he manages to find passage with a smuggler who helps him escape the planet.

as the ship makes the jump into Hyperspace, an ion blast from a republic ship causes both passengars to be knocked out and the navigation systems to fail. The result is a longer and faster hyperspace jump than anyone has completed before. The final shot shows the two runaways looking out of their ship at the strange new planet they have found.
