## Location

Many of the choices in this film will be dictated by what resources I have access to. I chose to set the story on Tatooine, mainly because it is easier to make a realistic desert with CGI than most other environments. The main reason is that I need an environment that can include Star Wars styled buildings And I was able to find a couple of Tatooine packs for free. I also chose the time period of Order 66 because I have a good 3d model of a Venator-class Star Destroyer, and If I do CGI clone troopers than I will need fewer actors.

## The Background Story

I plan to include a flashback scene to give a reason for the Jedi to distrust the Clone Troopers. He is a fairly ordinary Jedi, so I need some reason he is able to escape the clones when most of the other Jedi are not.

I considered making the Jedi's mission be to kill the Lars family (because they could be linked to Anakin Skywalker, and because Palpatine knew about the Skywalker twins) but the timeline does not fit, and I do not currently know anyone who could play Owen and Beru. I may still include a post-credits scene of Obi-Wan arriving right after the Jedi leaves.

## The Ending

The idea with this ending is that this short film could act as a pilot episode to make a series of the Jedi and Smuggler exploring the remote planet they discover and attempting to make their way home.

I actually wrote this ending first before deciding on any of the story that would lead to it. Most of the rest of the story has been driven by the need to get one or more characters in a malfunctioned hyperspace jump.
